# Fedora-Hardening
Hardening script for Fedora 30

The script is based upon the CIS Red Hat 7 Benchmark Level 1 for workstations but some of the controls are not being employed because the machines are for development and will require a little more freedom.

Any level 1 controls that haven't been employed are still in the script but commented-out in case you need to fully harden a machine.
